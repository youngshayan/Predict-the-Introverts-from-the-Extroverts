# Predict-the-Introverts-from-the-Extroverts
This project was built for a Kaggle competition to predict whether a person is an introvert or extrovert based on social behavior and personality traits. It uses data preprocessing, label encoding, and a Random Forest classifier to achieve high accuracy on the test set.
